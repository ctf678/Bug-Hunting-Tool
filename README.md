# Bug-Hunting-Tool

This is an automation tool for bug hunting, which includes subdomain enumeration and security checks. I created it to simplify bug hunting and automate common tasks like subdomain discovery and directory brute-forcing.

## Changes

I adapted various open-source tools and modified the output format to make it better for my testing purposes. Here's what I added:

- Subdomain enumeration using Subfinder
- Directory brute-forcing for potential vulnerabilities
- SSL/TLS checks
