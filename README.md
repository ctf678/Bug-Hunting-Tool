# Bug-Hunting-Tool

This is an automation tool for bug hunting, which includes subdomain enumeration and security checks. I created it to simplify bug hunting and automate common tasks like subdomain discovery and directory brute-forcing.

## Changes

I adapted various open-source tools and modified the output format to make it better for my testing purposes. Here's what I added:

- Subdomain enumeration using Subfinder
- Directory brute-forcing for potential vulnerabilities
- SSL/TLS checks

### Key Points:
1. **Title**: Use `#` for the main title (Bug-Hunting-Tool).
2. **Sections**: Separate each section using `---` (for example, after the "Changes" section).
3. **Code**: Enclose commands and code snippets in triple backticks (```bash or ```python),
 and for inline code use single backticks (`).
4. **Bullet Points**: For lists like "Changes", use `-` for each point.
5. **Links**: You can add external links like your "contact" link using markdown syntax `[alt text](link)`.

With this structure, you will get a neat and easy-to-read `README.md` file with all the
